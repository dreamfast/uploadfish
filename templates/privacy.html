            <h2>2. Client-Side Encryption</h2>
            <p>When you enable client-side encryption, your files are encrypted in your browser before being uploaded to our servers. We do not have access to the encryption keys, which are only shared in the URL fragment (#) and never sent to our servers.</p>
